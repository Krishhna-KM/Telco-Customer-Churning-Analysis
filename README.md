# Project Title: Telco Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Description:
This project aims to analyze customer churn for a telecommunications company using machine learning techniques. Churn refers to the percentage of customers that stop using the company's services over a given period. Understanding the reasons behind customer churn is crucial for telecom companies to implement better retention strategies.

## Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the raw data for analysis, including handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and analyzing the dataset to understand correlations and key drivers of churn.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve the predictive power of the model.
Modeling Techniques: Building various classification models, including decision trees, ensemble methods, and voting classifiers.
Evaluation: Evaluating models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and AUC-ROC curves.

## Dataset:
Source: The dataset used is the publicly available "Telco Customer Churn" dataset, which contains details about a telecom company's customers, such as customer demographics, account details, services subscribed to, and whether or not they churned.
Columns: Some important columns include CustomerID, Tenure, Contract Type, Monthly Charges, and Churn.

## Libraries Used:
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
Seaborn & Matplotlib: For data visualization.
Scikit-Learn: For machine learning modeling and evaluation.
Imbalanced-Learn (SMOTE): To handle class imbalance in the churn data.

## Steps:
Data Import & Cleaning: Importing necessary libraries and the dataset, handling missing data, and preparing it for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distribution, correlation matrices, and churn rate.
Data Preprocessing: Encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and applying SMOTE for class balancing.
Modeling: Building models like Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Voting Classifier for churn prediction.
Model Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC to evaluate model performance.

## How to Run:
Install the required libraries (e.g., using pip install -r requirements.txt).
Run the notebook (.ipynb) for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Results:
Insights from EDA and the most influential factors for customer churn.
Performance metrics of various machine learning models.

## Future Work:
Fine-tuning models for better performance.
Incorporating additional features or datasets.
